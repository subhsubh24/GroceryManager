# Pending Ops

Migrations, env-var additions, or infra changes that need to be applied at deploy time.
The autonomous loop appends here when a code change requires a manual step at deploy.

## 2026-06-23 — 0010_rls_catalog.sql (RLS on shared catalog tables)

Enables RLS + a permissive `grocery_app` policy on the six shared catalog tables
(`units_of_measure`, `canonical_items`, `products`, `recipes`, `recipe_ingredients`,
`item_unit_conversions`) to close the Supabase Security Advisor "RLS Disabled in Public"
errors (anon/authenticated could read+write the shared catalog via PostgREST).

**Status: ALREADY APPLIED to the production Supabase DB on 2026-06-23 (via MCP `apply_migration`).**
The migration is idempotent, so the next `pnpm --filter @gm/db db:migrate` run is a safe no-op
that simply brings other environments in sync. No further action required for prod.
