# GROWTH STATUS — GroceryManager

The single, machine-readable source of truth for **growth & marketing progress**, owned by the
**Growth Agent** (the daily cloud routine). The factory dashboard reads the fenced `GROWTH_STATUS`
block below — exactly like it reads `BUSINESS_CASE_SUMMARY` in `docs/BUSINESS_CASE.md`. This is how
the owner sees pre-launch / launch / post-launch growth progress in one place.

## Contract (read before editing)

- **The Growth Agent updates the block below every run**, in the SAME run it does growth work.
- **Real data only — never invent numbers** (VISION's honesty bar applies here absolutely). A metric
  that no connected analytics source has reported yet stays `0` or `null`. A non-null number must be
  traceable to a real source (the in-app `/admin/waitlist` analytics, the connected email provider,
  the connected channel's own analytics, Stripe). No estimates, no "looks good," no fabricated proof.
- **The block MUST be valid, parseable YAML** — no invalid escapes (write `$100K`, never `\$100K`).
  `scripts/preflight.sh` fails on a malformed block, because a malformed block makes the dashboard
  degrade to "unparseable → link" instead of showing progress.
- **Cross-project shape (identical across AptDesignerAI / HighlightMagic / GroceryManager)** so the
  owner's dashboard can compare all three side by side. Keep the keys identical; only the values differ.
- **`phase`** advances `pre_launch` → `launching` → `post_launch`. **Post-launch is the most important
  window** — that's when real conversion/retention/CAC data arrives and the agent compounds it into
  better growth strategy. Keep `learnings` and `experiments` richest here.
- **`as_of`** is stamped every update. A stale `as_of` (the agent didn't run / had nothing real to
  report) is itself a signal — never bump the date without a real reason.

## How to read it (owner)

- **`awaiting_connect: true`** + **`engine_built: false`** → the agent is in honest *prepare* mode:
  sharpening content/email/ASO in-repo, taking no external action. Look at `owner_blockers` for what to
  connect to switch it into *execute* mode.
- **`funnel`** is the headline: waitlist signups (pre-launch), then trial→paid + MRR + churn (post-launch).
- **`experiments`** is where compounding happens post-launch — each is a real A/B with a decided result.
- **`learnings`** is the agent's running, data-grounded read on what's driving (or not driving) signups.

## Phase notes

- **Pre-launch:** the number that matters is **waitlist signups** and the channels feeding them. Most of
  the block is `0`/`null`; that's correct and honest.
- **Launching:** trial starts + first conversions appear; `experiments` should be running on the paywall
  and onboarding.
- **Post-launch (compounding):** ground every assumption on REAL conversion / retention / CAC data; run
  continuous experiments; double down on what converts, cut what doesn't; feed the winners back into the
  business case. This is the long game that grows revenue past the $100K floor.
