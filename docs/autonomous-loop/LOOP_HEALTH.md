# Loop health — is the LOOP getting better, or just busier?

The `QUALITY_SCORECARD` measures the **product**; this measures the **loop itself** (FACTORY_STANDARD §10b).

**Contract (read before editing):**
- **Update EVERY run, in the bookkeeping PR**, with REAL counts — `git log`/`gh` for merged/revert/readiness
  history + this run's own shipped/abandoned/verify/review/circuit-breaker tallies.
- **Honest only** — same anti-gaming rule as the business-case number. Never flatter a count; an ugly
  `churning`/`stuck` signal is the POINT (it triggers a harness proposal). `0`/`null` until real.
- **CLASSIFY every abandoned change** (`abandoned_reasons`) so the loop does NOT re-attempt the same dead-end
  — "don't repeat the failed path."
- **Dashboard-readable** — keep the fenced `LOOP_HEALTH` block valid, parseable YAML.
- **Refresh the `validation` sub-block every run** from `node scripts/check-self-validation.mjs --readiness`
  (`capabilities_total`/`active`/`unmet`/`unmet_unsurfaced`). Any **unmet** capability (one needing an owner
  secret the loop can't supply) MUST appear in BOTH `validation.unmet` here AND an urgent `OWNER_ACTION`
  `validation-capability-<service>` in `PENDING_OPS.md`; `unmet_unsurfaced` must stay empty.
- **Observability, NOT a ship gate** — this never blocks a merge or readiness; it informs.
- `signal` honest read: `churning` (high abandon/revert vs. shipped) or `stuck` (recurring failures / no
  convergence) → open ONE `loop: harness improvement proposal` issue (the META channel — the only way the
  loop's OWN rules improve, since it can't edit its routine / `.claude/`).
- `abandoned_reasons` enum is adapted to THIS stack (pnpm/Turborepo web + Expo mobile): `gate_tsc`
  (`pnpm -r run typecheck`), `gate_test` (`@gm/core` vitest), `gate_build` (`next build` + missing-export
  grep), `gate_mobile` (`apps/mobile` typecheck), `review_value`, `review_correctness`, `circuit_breaker`,
  `conflict`, `dead_end`, `blocked_owner`.

      - "STALE local origin/main (run 44): the env cloned + checked out the run-43 tip (d48c0dd/#385) as a DETACHED HEAD, but local `origin/main`/`main` refs still pointed at #369 (14 commits behind). Branching from `main` cut the feature branch off stale #369, which made #379's merged worker-stub fix APPEAR reverted (the pre-#379 `stub()` was on the stale base, not real main). RESOLVED: `git fetch origin main` fast-forwarded origin/main to #385, confirmed #379 IS merged (no regression), then `git branch -f main origin/main` + rebased the feature branch onto real main (clean — file-disjoint). LESSON: ALWAYS `git fetch origin main && git branch -f main origin/main` (or branch from `origin/main`, not `main`) at run start BEFORE trusting local main / diagnosing a 'missing fix' — a stale ref manufactures phantom regressions. RECURRED run 53: local `main` was 36 commits behind origin/main; branches cut from it carried phantom diffs (#451's wrapped `empty` reformatting appeared as mine). Same fix — `git reset --hard origin/main` then recreate branches from stash (only wrapped.tsx had changed upstream; the stash already contained #451, so per-file checkout = origin/main + my edit). 2nd occurrence (runs 44, 53) — the standing mitigation is a run-start `git reset --hard origin/main`; if it recurs a 3rd time, propose a harness pre-flight that hard-syncs local main before scouting."
      - "branch-entanglement (runs 39, 41): a review/build subagent sharing the parent git working tree ran a checkout that left the tree a MIX on top of the correct pushed commit. HARMLESS both times — commits were already pushed; verify origin/<branch> via `git show` (not the shared tree) + `git reset --hard HEAD` to recover. Persistent-but-benign; mitigation = worktree isolation for mutating parallel agents. No harness proposal (no lost work, no red merge)."
      - "recurring #0a6e33 re-flag (runs 35, 41): a design scout keeps proposing `brand-solid` for the deep-green-on-white hardcode (an AA regression). RESOLVED in #372 by moving to the byte-exact `brand-solid-hover` token + an in-code contrast comment at each site — the re-flag can't recur. No harness proposal needed."
      - "admin low-value design re-flag (runs 48, 49, 50): a design scout keeps surfacing internal-admin design nits — run 48/49 the `text-brand-solid`→`-hover` contrast INVERSE trap (`brand-solid`/`-hover` are SURFACE tokens, correct for `bg-*` where hover=darker, but as `text-*` FOREGROUND on the near-black admin bg darker = LESS contrast, a dark-mode regression, why #424 was abandoned); run 50 the admin/growth + admin/waitlist section-title `<p>` semantics (WCAG 1.3.1) + raw `text-amber-600`/`text-green-600` tokens. All admin is owner-internal, never store-reviewed, low-surface — deferred each time (run-45 precedent) to a dedicated admin design/dark-mode pass, never a per-element hack. Watch: if admin design re-flags again, either do the one dedicated admin pass (mode-aware foreground token + `<h2>` section titles + semantic status colors) OR add in-code comments at each admin site (like #372 did for the light-mode case) to stop the recurring re-flag."
      - "Haiku-scout false positives keep needing re-verification (runs 42,43,44,45,47): a cheap scout produces a plausible 'bug' against a deliberate design (ewmaConsumptionRate; server-action raw throws; recipe alt='') or an environment artifact (mobile '771 TS errors' = deps-not-installed). MITIGATION already in the loop: the orchestrator VERIFIES every scout finding before selecting (design intent at the site; `npm ci` before a mobile typecheck; adjacent-text check before an alt='' 'fix'). Working as intended — the verify step catches them; NOT a harness proposal (the model split expects cheap scouts to over-report; the maker's verification is the guard)."

## How to read it (owner)
- **`improving`/`steady`** — shipping clears the bar, few abandons/reverts, readiness attempts converge.
- **`churning`** — lots abandoned/reverted vs. shipped → the loop is busy, not better. Check
  `abandoned_reasons` for the pattern.
- **`stuck`** — `recurring_failures` keeps naming the same wall and `harness_proposals_open` is 0 → the META
  channel is dead; raise a `loop: harness improvement proposal`.
- A quiet honest run with a small shipped count + a clean signal is a SUCCESS; a high `changes_shipped` with
  a high abandon/revert rate is NOT.
